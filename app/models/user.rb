  # Devise automatically downcases and strips any attribute defined in

  # call will be made to downcase and strip the email.

  # To avoid these unnecessary DB calls, we've set case_insensitive_keys and
  # strip_whitespace_keys to empty arrays in config/initializers/devise.rb.
  # In addition, we've overridden the downcase_keys and strip_whitespace
  # methods below to do nothing.
  #
  # Note that we already downcase and strip emails, and only when necessary
  # (i.e. when the email attribute is being created or updated, and when a user
  # is entering an email address in a form). This is the proper way to handle
  # this formatting, as opposed to via a model callback that performs this
  # action regardless of whether or not it is needed. Search the codebase for
  # ".downcase.strip" for examples.

  # is called automatically when a user is created due to a Devise callback.
  # If we didn't disable it, the user would receive two confirmation emails.
